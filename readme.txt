Revenue Share Wordpress Plugin for Authors:

This plugin helps you to give a small reward to your guest blog writers in terms of revenue. Their own advertisements will be displayed for all their posts on your blog for 50% of the impressions. For this they just have to fill up a field in their profile section with their adsense publisher id.

This plugin adds a field to all your blog post authors' profiles for inserting their Google adsense publisher id and creates a Settings page which will be accessible to admin of the website. The settings page include a field to fill up admin's adsense pub id as well as the position where the ad should be displayed. For now this plugin supports 2 adspots, Top of the post, Middle, and Bottom.
